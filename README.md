# Scratch_Earthquake_Simulation-JPNv0.03-
Note: This Scratch simulation project is not fully made by myself!
The original file is downloaded online, I just made a few changes to the project.

Using Left/Right Arrow Keys to change M; and Up/Down to change Depth
Click your mouse to choose the epicenter and then press space to start.

The project uses some costumes from SREV made by kotoho7.
